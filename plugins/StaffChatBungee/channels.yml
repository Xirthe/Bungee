# Welcome to Staff Chat Bungee.
# Configure your cross-server channels here.
# Formatting:
# - All channels will format with:
# - '[Channel] [Server] Username: message'
# - [] can be replaced using the 'borders' setting.
# - Each component is customized in the appropriate area.
# Showing components:
# - To hide a component in the display, set "show" to "false".
# Coloring components:
# - To leave text white, just set color to "f".
# - To color it just set a color code (e.g. "c", "d", "e"). Do NOT include any symbols before a code. One letter only.
# - View applicable color codes here: http://minecraft.tools/en/color-code.php
# Commands:
# - Commands are registered during load-time based on the values here. Firstly, there will be a command registered with
# - the name of the channel. The name is the key, e.g. "staff:" and "admin:". The command will be /staff or /admin
# - respectively. The command-aliases option has a list of other aliases you can also use to access the channel.
# - The default settings provide /staff, /s, /admin, and /a.
# Symbol triggers;
# - These one-letter symbols allow your users to quickly send a message to a channel by prefixing the message with
# - the symbol. E.g. "/staff hello" is the same as "!hello" if "!" is a symbol trigger for channel "staff".
# - If you'd rather not use these, just set the symbol-triggers value to a plain set of square-brackets: []
